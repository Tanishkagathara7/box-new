# Payment Gateway Redirect Implementation

## Overview
Implemented payment gateway redirect functionality with success/failure message handling for the BoxCric application.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Server-Side Payment Callback Routes**

#### Added `/api/payments/callback` route (`server/routes/payments.js`)
- Handles redirects from Cashfree payment gateway
- Processes payment status (PAID, FAILED, EXPIRED, ACTIVE)
- Redirects users back to home page with appropriate URL parameters
- Supports both development and production environments

#### Added `/api/payments/cancel` route (`server/routes/payments.js`)
- Handles payment cancellation when users exit payment gateway
- Redirects to home page with cancellation message

#### Updated Payment Order Creation
- Modified return URL to use local callback endpoint
- Added booking_id parameter to track which booking the payment is for
- Updated both development and production configurations

### 2. **Frontend Payment Callback Handling**

#### Updated Index Page (`src/pages/Index.tsx`)
- Added `useSearchParams` hook to read URL parameters
- Implemented payment status detection and message display
- Added toast notifications for different payment outcomes:
  - ‚úÖ **Success**: "üéâ Payment successful! Your booking has been confirmed."
  - ‚ùå **Failed**: "‚ùå Payment failed. Please try again."
  - ‚ùå **Cancelled**: "‚ùå Payment was cancelled."
  - ‚è≥ **Pending**: "‚è≥ Payment is being processed. Please wait."
  - ‚ùå **Error**: "‚ùå Payment processing error."

#### Enhanced PaymentModal (`src/components/PaymentModal.tsx`)
- Added payment cancellation event handlers
- Implemented cleanup effects for payment processing
- Added beforeunload event listener to handle browser tab closure
- Enhanced error handling for payment gateway exits

## Payment Flow

### Success Flow
1. User clicks "Pay" button
2. Redirected to Cashfree payment gateway
3. User completes payment successfully
4. Cashfree redirects to `/api/payments/callback?order_status=PAID`
5. Server redirects to home page with `?payment=success`
6. Frontend shows success toast message

### Failure Flow
1. User clicks "Pay" button
2. Redirected to Cashfree payment gateway
3. Payment fails or user cancels
4. Cashfree redirects to `/api/payments/callback?order_status=FAILED`
5. Server redirects to home page with `?payment=failed`
6. Frontend shows failure toast message

### Cancellation Flow
1. User clicks "Pay" button
2. Redirected to Cashfree payment gateway
3. User exits payment gateway
4. Cashfree redirects to `/api/payments/cancel`
5. Server redirects to home page with `?payment=cancelled`
6. Frontend shows cancellation toast message

## URL Parameters

### Success
```
/?payment=success&booking_id=ABC123&order_id=ORDER456
```

### Failure
```
/?payment=failed&booking_id=ABC123&order_id=ORDER456&error=Payment%20declined
```

### Cancelled
```
/?payment=cancelled&booking_id=ABC123&order_id=ORDER456
```

### Pending
```
/?payment=pending&booking_id=ABC123&order_id=ORDER456
```

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Frontend URL: `http://localhost:5173`
- Backend URL: `http://localhost:3001`
- Callback URL: `http://localhost:3001/api/payments/callback`

### Production
- Frontend URL: `https://boxcric.netlify.app`
- Backend URL: Your production server
- Callback URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/payments/callback`

## Testing

Created `test-payment-callback.js` to verify callback functionality:
- Tests successful payment callback
- Tests failed payment callback
- Tests cancelled payment callback
- Tests pending payment callback

## Security Features

1. **URL Parameter Cleanup**: URL parameters are cleared after processing to prevent replay
2. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for all payment scenarios
3. **Logging**: Detailed logging for debugging payment issues
4. **Validation**: Input validation for payment callback parameters

## User Experience

- **Clear Messages**: Users receive clear, informative messages about payment status
- **Immediate Feedback**: Toast notifications appear immediately upon return from payment gateway
- **Consistent UI**: All payment outcomes are handled consistently
- **No Confusion**: Users always know the status of their payment attempt

## Files Modified

1. `server/routes/payments.js` - Added callback and cancel routes
2. `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Added payment callback handling
3. `src/components/PaymentModal.tsx` - Enhanced payment flow
4. `test-payment-callback.js` - Created test script

## Next Steps

1. Test the implementation in development environment
2. Deploy to production and test with real payments
3. Monitor payment success rates and error logs
4. Consider adding payment analytics and reporting
