# Grounds Availability Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Grounds Not Showing in MongoDB**
**Problem**: The filter was too restrictive - only showing `status: "active"` AND `isVerified: true` grounds.

**Fix**: Removed the `isVerified: true` requirement temporarily to show all active grounds.

**Location**: `server/routes/grounds.js` line 158
```javascript
// Before
const filter = { status: "active", isVerified: true };

// After  
const filter = { status: "active" }; // Remove isVerified requirement for now
```

### 2. **"Fully Booked" Issue**
**Problem**: The availability logic was using `demoBookings` instead of real MongoDB bookings.

**Fix**: Updated to fetch real bookings from MongoDB and properly process them.

**Location**: `server/routes/grounds.js` lines 242-270
```javascript
// Fetch real bookings from MongoDB
let todayBookings = [];
try {
  const Booking = mongoose.model('Booking');
  todayBookings = await Booking.find({
    groundId: { $in: groundIds },
    bookingDate: today,
    status: { $in: ["pending", "confirmed"] }
  }).select('groundId timeSlot').lean();
  
  console.log(`ðŸ“… Found ${todayBookings.length} real bookings for today`);
} catch (bookingError) {
  console.log("Could not fetch bookings from MongoDB, using demo data:", bookingError.message);
  // Fallback to demo bookings if MongoDB fails
  todayBookings = demoBookings.filter(
    (b) => groundIds.includes(b.groundId) && b.bookingDate === today
  );
}
```

### 3. **Ahmedabad Not Supported**
**Problem**: The fallback logic only worked for "mumbai" and "delhi" cities.

**Fix**: Updated to support all cities.

**Location**: `server/routes/grounds.js` line 275
```javascript
// Before
if (grounds.length === 0 && (cityId === "mumbai" || cityId === "delhi")) {

// After
if (grounds.length === 0) {
```

### 4. **Enhanced Debugging**
**Added comprehensive logging** to track:
- Number of grounds found for each city
- Number of real bookings found
- Individual booking details
- Availability calculation for each ground
